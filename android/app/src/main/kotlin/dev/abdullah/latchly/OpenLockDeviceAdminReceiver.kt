 * is what makes Android refuse to uninstall the app until admin is deactivated.
 * OpenLock only ever deactivates it from within the app after a successful
 * PIN/biometric check (see the "Prevent uninstall" toggle), and best-effort
 * guards the OS deactivate-admin screen with the lock overlay. It never locks,
 * wipes, or otherwise manages the device.
