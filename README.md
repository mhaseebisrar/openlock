# 🔒 OpenLock

### Lock any app behind your PIN.

Pick the apps that matter and OpenLock guards them with a PIN or fingerprint — with focus schedules, uninstall protection, and an intruder log, all offline.

> ### 🔒 Private by design
> OpenLock runs **completely offline**. Your lock settings and any intruder photos are **encrypted on your device and never leave it** — no account, no cloud, no servers, no tracking.

Most app lockers ask for sign-ups, show ads, or phone home with the list of apps you hide. OpenLock doesn't have servers. Everything — which apps you lock, your schedules, your PIN verifier, intruder snapshots — stays on your phone, encrypted.

## ✨ Features

**Lock what matters**
- Pick any installed app from a searchable list with icons and lock it behind your **PIN or fingerprint**
- **Lock newly installed apps automatically**
- Choose exactly when apps relock: **the moment you leave**, after **1 / 5 / 15 / 30 min**, or **when the screen turns off**

**Focus Schedules** ⭐
- Lock a chosen set of apps during **time windows** — e.g. social apps 9-5 on weekdays, games during study time
- Weekday sets, overnight windows, and all-day rules — enforced automatically by the background guard

**Uninstall protection** 🛡️
- Turn on **Prevent uninstall** so OpenLock can't be removed on a whim — Android blocks the uninstall until you turn protection back off **with your PIN or fingerprint**
- See [How uninstall protection works](#-uninstall-protection) below — including its honest limits

**Stay in control**
- **Intruder log** — after too many wrong attempts, OpenLock silently snaps a front-camera photo and logs the time and app
- **Anti-shoulder-surfing** — optional randomized keypad and a masked PIN
- Escalating **cooldown** after repeated wrong guesses
- Optional **decoy cover** — show a fake "app has stopped" dialog; a long-press reveals the real unlock

**Yours to keep**
- **Encrypted backup & restore** (`.olbackup`) protected by a passphrase of your choosing
- Change your PIN, toggle fingerprint unlock, and manage everything from Settings

## 🧠 How it works

OpenLock uses the standard, Play-acceptable technique for cross-app locking — **Usage Access + an overlay**, never an accessibility service:

1. A lightweight **foreground service** watches which app is in the foreground using Android's `UsageStatsManager` (polling recent usage events).
2. When a **locked** app comes to the front and isn't in an unlocked session (per your relock policy and schedules), OpenLock launches a native **lock screen** over it.
3. The lock screen verifies your PIN against a stored **verifier hash** (never the raw PIN) entirely on-device, or accepts your **fingerprint** (the prompt auto-appears each time the lock screen shows, with the PIN pad always there as a fallback), then lets you through.
4. A **boot receiver** restarts the guard after a reboot.

The main app (app picker, schedules, settings, onboarding) is Flutter with the shared Secure Suite design system; the on-top lock screen is native Kotlin for reliability.

> **Note:** Cross-app locking is **Android-only by platform design** — iOS does not allow one app to lock another. Real lock behavior requires granting the permissions below on a **physical device**; it cannot be exercised in an emulator or automated test.

## 🛡️ Uninstall protection

An app lock is only as good as its resistance to being switched off. OpenLock offers an optional **Prevent uninstall** toggle (Settings → Security) built on Android's **device administrator** API:

- **Enabling it** launches the system "activate device admin" dialog. Once OpenLock is an active device admin, **Android refuses to uninstall it** — the OS itself shows "This app is a device administrator and must be deactivated before you can uninstall."
- **Turning it back off is auth-gated.** OpenLock will **only** deactivate device admin after a successful **PIN or fingerprint** check *inside the app*. There is no silent deactivation path in the UI — flip the toggle off, prove it's you, and only then is admin removed.
- **Best-effort screen guard.** While protection is on, the background monitor also watches for the OS screens that could be used to disable it — the **Settings → device-admin deactivation** screen, this app's **App info / uninstall** screen, and the **package-installer** uninstall dialog — and throws up the lock screen (PIN/biometric) over them first.

### Honest limits

The screen guard is **best-effort and Android-version / OEM dependent** — please don't treat it as unbreakable:

- It relies on `UsageStatsManager` reporting the foreground activity's class name. Some OEM skins and **newer Android releases** name, reorder, or restrict these screens differently, so the overlay may not always fire in time (there's an inherent poll-and-launch race).
- Because the App-info screen doesn't reveal *which* app is being viewed, the guard is intentionally broad: it may also prompt for your PIN when you open **another** app's info/uninstall page while protection is on.
- Device admin blocks the normal uninstall flow, but a determined user with **ADB, Safe Mode, or a factory reset** can still remove any non-system app. This is a deterrent against casual/opportunistic removal — the documented technique app lockers use — not a guarantee against a technical adversary with physical access.
- The device-admin dialog and the guard require the permissions listed below; on devices where they're unavailable the toggle simply won't take effect.

You can always remove protection yourself: toggle **Prevent uninstall** off (authenticating with your PIN), which deactivates device admin and restores normal uninstall.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Offline-only.** No network code, nothing to leak.
- **Your PIN is never stored.** OpenLock keeps only a salted **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** verifier hash. The same algorithm runs in Dart and in native Kotlin so the lock screen can check your PIN offline, byte-for-byte identically.
- **Encrypted at rest.** Your full config (locked apps, schedules, settings) is encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** under a random key held in Android's hardware-backed Keystore (`flutter_secure_storage`). The subset the native guard needs lives in **EncryptedSharedPreferences**.
- **Intruder photos stay on the device**, in app-private storage, and can be deleted any time.
- **Encrypted backups.** `.olbackup` files are encrypted with a separate passphrase (Argon2id-derived key) — a backup file alone is useless to anyone else.
- **Device admin is used narrowly.** OpenLock declares only a minimal policy (to satisfy the schema) purely to block its own uninstall; it never locks, wipes, or manages your device, and deactivation is auth-gated.
- **No accounts, no telemetry, no ads.**

## 🔑 Permissions — and why

OpenLock asks only for what cross-app locking genuinely needs, and explains each in-app on a guided checklist:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage access** (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`) | To detect which app is in the foreground so a locked app can be caught. This is the standard, non-accessibility way to do app-lock. |
| **Display over other apps** (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`) | To show the lock screen on top of a locked app, and to launch it reliably from the background on modern Android. |
| **Foreground service** (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE` / `_SPECIAL_USE`) | To keep the guard running with an ongoing notification. |
| **Notifications** (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`) | To show the ongoing "protection active" notice (Android 13+). |
| **Device administrator** (`BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN`) | Optional — only if you enable **Prevent uninstall**. Being an active device admin is what makes Android block the app's uninstall until you turn protection off with your PIN. |
| **Ignore battery optimization** | Optional, but keeps the guard alive in the background on aggressive OEM ROMs. |
| **Camera** | Optional — only used for silent intruder snapshots if you enable that feature. |
| **Run at boot** (`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`) | To restart protection after the phone restarts. |
| **Query all packages** (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`) | To list the launchable apps you can choose to lock. OpenLock reads labels/icons/package names **locally only**; nothing about your installed apps ever leaves the device. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (matching this repo's channel) and Android Studio.

```sh
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/MalicKAbdullah/openlock.git
cd openlock

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Run on a connected Android device (recommended over an emulator)
flutter run
```

> Locally, the shared `core_*` packages are wired as **path dependencies** to `../../packages`. At publish time they point at the [secure-suite-core](https://github.com/MalicKAbdullah/secure-suite-core) git repository, like the other suite apps.

**Build a debug/release APK:**

```sh
flutter build apk --debug
flutter build apk --release
```

Run the checks the way CI does:

```sh
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

**App icon:** a launcher icon can be dropped into `assets/icon/` and wired up with `flutter_launcher_icons` later; the current build ships the default adaptive icon.
